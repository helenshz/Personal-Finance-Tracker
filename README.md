# Personal Finance Tracker

This is a simple web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core (EF Core), designed to help users locally track and manage personal income and expense transactions.

This project serves as a portfolio piece to showcase proficiency in C# backend development, SQL database operations (via EF Core), and basic Web UI design.
